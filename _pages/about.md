I am an aspiring Ph.D. researcher in Medical AI and Computer Vision, currently serving as a Research Assistant at **Carnegie Mellon University (Xu Lab)** and **Northwestern University (MHI Lab)**.

I hold a B.E. in Computer Engineering from **Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology**, where I graduated as the **#1 ranked student** in the department with a **GPA of 9.27/10.0**. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Min Xu, Dr. Xingjian Li, and Prof. Ulas Bagci. My recent achievements include being the **Winner of the Fetal Ultrasound Grand Challenge** at ISBI 2025.



## Research Focus

My research philosophy centers on **mathematically grounded modeling** and **foundation-model-driven designs**. I am particularly interested in tackling **learning with imperfect annotations** (semi/unsupervised learning) to bridge the gap between advanced vision models and clinical reality.

The three interconnected pillars of my research are:

* **Foundation-Model-Driven Designs** — Leveraging large-scale pre-trained models (e.g., SAM) through principled adaptation strategies rather than naive fine-tuning.

* **Mathematically Grounded Modeling** — Building theoretically motivated architectures, including Mixture-of-Experts, disentangled representations, and diffusion models.

* **Learning with Imperfect Annotations** — Developing robust AI systems that operate effectively with limited, noisy, or domain-shifted medical data.
